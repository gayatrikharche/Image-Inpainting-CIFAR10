# Context Encoders for Unsupervised Visual Feature Learning

## ðŸ“– Overview
This project explores unsupervised visual feature learning methods, focusing on **Context Encoders**. Context Encoders aim to predict missing parts of images using surrounding pixel context. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model learns to reconstruct images, enhancing its understanding of visual content.

### Key Features
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: 
  - Compresses input data into a latent space representation.
  - Reconstructs images from this representation, allowing for comprehensive understanding of the entire image content.

- **Loss Functions**: 
  - Utilizes various loss functions, including pixel-wise reconstruction loss and adversarial loss, to improve the quality of generated images.

- **Quantitative Analysis**: 
  - Demonstrates that Context Encoders effectively acquire representations that capture both appearance and semantic visual structures.

### Dataset
The model is validated on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, showcasing its ability to learn meaningful features from images with missing regions.
